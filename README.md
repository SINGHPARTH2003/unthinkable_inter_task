# Healthcare Symptom Checker

An AI-powered healthcare symptom analysis application that provides educational insights about possible medical conditions and recommendations based on user-described symptoms.

## ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This application is for **educational purposes only** and should NOT replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a healthcare AI assignment to demonstrate:
- Integration of Large Language Models (LLM) for medical symptom analysis
- Full-stack web application development
- Secure API handling and data persistence
- User-friendly interface for healthcare information

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User's Device (Frontend)
    ↓
API Endpoint (/check-symptoms)
    ↓
LLM Service (Gemini AI)
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL)
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Symptom Input**: Users can describe their symptoms in natural language
- **AI Analysis**: Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent symptom analysis
- **Condition Suggestions**: Provides 2-4 probable conditions with likelihood ratings
- **Recommendations**: Offers general health advice and next steps
- **History Logging**: Stores queries in database for analysis (optional)
- **Safety First**: Clear medical disclaimers and educational-only messaging

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for UI components
- **Vite** for build tooling

### Backend
- **Lovable Cloud** (Supabase-powered)
- **Edge Functions** for serverless API
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Google Gemini AI** via Lovable AI Gateway

### Deployment
- **GitHub** for version control
- **Vercel** for hosting (recommended)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git for version control
- GitHub account (for deployment)
- Vercel account (for hosting)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd healthcare-symptom-checker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

The project uses Lovable Cloud, which automatically configures:
- Database connection
- AI API keys
- Edge function deployment

No manual environment variable setup needed!

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Push your code to GitHub first
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Vite settings
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed)
   - Vercel will use the same environment variables from Lovable Cloud
   - No additional configuration required


## 📊 Database Schema

### symptom_checks table
```sql
CREATE TABLE symptom_checks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  symptoms TEXT NOT NULL,
  probable_conditions JSONB,
  recommendations TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Open the application**
2. **Enter symptoms** (e.g., "headache, fever, fatigue")
3. **Click "Analyze Symptoms"**
4. **Review results** - should show probable conditions and recommendations

### API Testing with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.lovable.app/functions/v1/check-symptoms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symptoms": "persistent cough and mild fever"}'
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ No personal health information stored beyond symptom text
- ✅ Public read/write access for educational demo purposes
- ✅ Rate limiting on AI API calls
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Clear disclaimers about educational use

## 🎓 Educational Use

This project demonstrates:
- **LLM Integration**: Proper prompting and response handling
- **Full-Stack Development**: Frontend + Backend + Database
- **API Design**: RESTful edge function architecture
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
- **UI/UX**: Clean, accessible healthcare interface

## 📝 Evaluation Criteria Coverage

✅ **Correctness**: App analyzes symptoms and provides relevant conditions  
✅ **LLM Reasoning Quality**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash with medical prompt engineering  
✅ **Safety Disclaimers**: Multiple disclaimer placements throughout UI  
✅ **Code Design**: Clean, modular architecture with TypeScript  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with setup instructions  
✅ **Demo**: Video demonstration included  

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Failed to analyze symptoms"
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and try again

**Issue**: Edge function not responding
- **Solution**: Verify Lovable Cloud is enabled and API keys are configured

**Issue**: Deployment fails on Vercel
- **Solution**: Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
